"""The state a developer can change while the simulated DEQ runs.

The simulator and its console are two processes: the backend holds the
simulated unit, and `tools/deq_console.py` changes what that unit reports.
A file is what they share. The console writes it, the simulator re-reads it
before each reply, so a change shows up in the next frame with nothing to
restart.

This is development tooling. It is not a model of the DEQ's protocol --
`app/testing/fake_deq.py` is that, and this only sets its fields. Nothing
here reaches hardware.

Every field is something a real DEQ-S1000A2 reports or did. There is
deliberately no "audio flowing" field: audio is a separate USB function and
the unit never reports on it, so a switch for it would invent a field the
protocol does not have.
