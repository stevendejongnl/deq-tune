"""Reads and writes the Pioneer DEQ's USB message format.

The DEQ speaks a SysEx-style framing over Android Open Accessory. The DEQ is
the accessory and the phone, or this app, is the host.

The rules here come from the Sound & Tune app's own codec, `b/g/d.pack()` and
`b/g/c.unpack()` in the decompiled APK, and were then checked against captured
traffic between the real app and a real unit. An earlier version of this
module guessed the layout from raw byte offsets; those offsets landed inside
the nibble-packed payload and happened to read correctly for two cases. This
version is the decoded rule.

A frame on the wire:

    0xf0
    header A, 3 bytes: 00 40 06
    header B, 4 bytes: 00 00 00 01
    the payload, nibble-expanded: each payload byte becomes two bytes,
        high nibble first, each in the range 0x00..0x0f
    0xf7
    one 0x00, but only when the frame would otherwise be an exact
        multiple of 512 bytes

Nibble expansion keeps every payload byte below 0x80, so the payload can never
look like a MIDI status byte. The payload length is not written anywhere; a
reader derives it from the frame size.

A payload, once unpacked, is little-endian throughout:

    0..1    direction: 1 for host to DEQ, 2 for DEQ to host
    2..3    command id
    4..7    length, which is the payload length minus 8
    8..15   transaction id, mirrored unchanged into the reply
    16..    the command's own fields

`deq_commands.json` lists every command's fields for both directions. It is
generated from the field enums in the APK, so it covers commands this app has
never seen on the wire.

Two traps in that table:

- A declared field width is a floor, not the truth. Command 0x05 says its
  CONFIGURATION is 16 bytes; a real equalizer write carries 2080. Read a
  configuration as "the rest of the payload".
- The pad rule above can never fire with the 7-byte header this unit uses,
  because a frame is then always an odd number of bytes. The codec keeps the
  rule because the header comes from a config object that another unit could
  set differently.
