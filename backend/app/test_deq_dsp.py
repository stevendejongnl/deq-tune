"""Checks the DSP maths against the app's own library.

`deq_dsp_reference.json` holds coefficients captured from
`jp.pioneer.mle.pmg.util.OpalParameter` on a running Sound & Tune app, with
the input that produced each one. A coefficient is stored as Q27, so two
designs that agree to one Q27 step produce the same bytes.
