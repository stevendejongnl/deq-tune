"""Drives the conversation with the DEQ.

`deq_protocol` says what one message looks like. This module says which
messages to send, in what order, and what a reply has to satisfy before the
app believes it.

The order comes from the real app. `USB_CAPTURE_NOTES.md` records the
sequence the Sound & Tune app sends on connect, read from a session that
reached a working connected state, and the same order appears in traffic
captured from a physical unit. The app is the authority on it, so
`STARTUP_STEPS` copies that order rather than inventing one.

Roles are the other way around from the capture. There the app is the host
and the DEQ answers. This app takes the host's place, so it sends those
commands and reads the DEQ's replies.

Three rules every reply must satisfy, all three confirmed against captured
traffic between the app and a real DEQ-S1000A2:

- the reply's command id equals the request's
- the reply's transaction id equals the request's, byte for byte
- STATUS, the first four body bytes, is zero

A reply that breaks one of these is not a reply to our request. The app's
own error codes come from the same checks: it raises `[Code:601]` when a
reply's content does not fit the request it answers.
