"""A DEQ unit that answers the way the real one does.

This is a `Transport`, so `DeqSession` talks to it exactly as it talks to a
real unit. No mocking library: a test passes one of these through the
session's constructor and reads `exchanges` afterwards.

Every rule below was measured from `captures/20260929_session_full.log`,
real traffic between the Pioneer app and a physical DEQ-S1000A2 — 217
matched request and reply pairs:

- the reply's command id equals the request's
- the reply's transaction id equals the request's, byte for byte
- the reply's length field is the request's plus 4
- STATUS, the first four body bytes, is zero
- the reply then echoes the request's own key field, where it has one

The last rule has one exception that matters. **The unit never echoes a
payload array back on a write.** A 2100-byte coefficient write gets a
24-byte acknowledgement, not a 2104-byte echo. Echoing a payload back is
what made the real app refuse a reply with `[Code:601]`, so this fake
refuses to do it too.

The fake raises on a command it does not know, rather than answering with
zeros. A silent zero-filled reply is what hid a real bug for days during
the protocol work: the app kept talking and only failed much later.
