"""Checks the accessory transport's framing, without a Pi or a socket.

Same story as `test_usb_transport.py`: this covers cutting whole frames
out of a byte stream, which is where a real link would most likely catch
this code out. The gadget relays the DEQ's own framing unchanged, so this
reuses the same frames and the same pad-byte rule.

The fake is a socket rather than a serial port, and the two differ in how
they report quiet: a socket raises `socket.timeout` and returns zero bytes
only when the far end has closed. Both cases are covered below, because
they mean different things to a session.
