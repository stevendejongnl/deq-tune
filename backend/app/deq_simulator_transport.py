"""A simulated DEQ whose answers a developer can change while it runs.

`DEQ_TRANSPORT=simulator` serves this instead of a real unit, so the whole
app runs with no hardware and a person can still see what happens when the
volume moves, the unit mutes, or a command fails.

It is `FakeDeq` plus a state file. `FakeDeq` holds every protocol rule,
measured from real traffic; this only copies the current state onto it
before each reply. Keeping them apart is the point: the protocol rules stay
pinned to captures, and the knobs stay out of them.

`DEQ_TRANSPORT=fake` still exists and is what the tests use. It takes its
state from its constructor and reads no file, so a test stays hermetic.
