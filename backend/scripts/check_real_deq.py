"""Checks this app against a real DEQ unit.

Everything in this project was built from the Pioneer app and from captured
traffic, with a fake unit standing in for the hardware. No real unit has
answered it yet. This script is what closes that gap: plug a DEQ in, run it,
and read what matched.

    cd backend
    PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/check_real_deq.py

It only reads, by default. Every step that writes to the unit is off unless
you ask for it:

    PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/check_real_deq.py --write

This uses `DEQ_TRANSPORT`, same as the app itself (`deq_device.py`). Run it
on the Pi, where the gadget holds the link:

    DEQ_TRANSPORT=accessory PYTHONPATH=. uv run python scripts/check_real_deq.py

`accessory` is the default transport for this script specifically (unlike
the app, whose default is `fake`) — checking a real unit is the one reason
to run it, and the Pi is what reaches one. `DEQ_TRANSPORT=fake` is rejected
here, since a check against the fake tells nothing about a real unit, which
is this script's only job.

`DEQ_TRANSPORT=usb` is the other real option, for a machine that can present
the device side of a USB link. It needs the `usb` extra
(`uv sync --extra usb`), and on Linux a plain user cannot usually open a USB
device directly: either run it with `sudo -E env PYTHONPATH=. ...`, or
install `scripts/99-pioneer-deq.rules` as a udev rule (install steps in its
own comment). The `accessory` transport needs neither, because it opens a
Unix socket and not the device.

What it prints is a list of checks, each `ok`, `differs` or `failed`, and a
count at the end. A `differs` line is the interesting one: it means the unit
answered, but not the way the captures and the APK said it would. Record any
of those in `USB_CAPTURE_NOTES.md` in the outer repo, because the app is the
authority and this code is what is under test.
