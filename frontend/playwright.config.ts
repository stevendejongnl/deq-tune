 * End-to-end tests, in a real browser.

 * These cover what jsdom cannot: real rendering, real CSS nesting, and the
 * whole path from a click to the backend and back. `vitest` keeps the unit
 * tests next to their components; these use `.spec.ts` under `e2e/` so the
 * two runners never pick up each other's files.
 *
 * The backend runs with `DEQ_TRANSPORT=fake`, so the unit the tests connect
 * to is the fake DEQ. No hardware, and the replies are the ones measured
 * from a real DEQ-S1000A2.
